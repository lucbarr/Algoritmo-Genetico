# Algoritmo-Genetico

A project for learning and practicing the concept of genetic algorithms in problem solving, by designing a code that can simulate evolution to find solutions to real problems. In this code, you might find concepts of biology merged into computational procedures, like genetic crossover, mutation, natural selection, chromossomes, genes, populations et cetera. This piece of code is entirely based in and inspired by the code provided in ai-junkie website Genetic Algorithm session.
